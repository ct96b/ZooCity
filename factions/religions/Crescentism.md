# Majority Practitioners & Venn Diagram

**Ethnic/Religious Overlap:**
- Crescentism is most common among desert and migratory species (e.g., camels, fennec foxes, gazelles, storks), but is open to all.
- The First Crescent (Sunni) is especially strong among camels and gazelles; the Moonlit Path (Shia) has a concentration among certain foxes and storks.
- The overlap between ethnicity and Crescentite faith is moderate: many Crescentites share a cultural background, but there are Crescentites from all walks of life, and many ethnicities have both religious and secular members.

**Venn Diagram Summary:**
- Some ethnic groups have a majority Crescentite population, but no group is exclusive.
- Converts and mixed-background Crescentites are common, especially in urban areas.
- There are secular members of all ethnicities, and Crescentism is not tied to a single ethnic identity.
# Crescentism (Proxy for Islam)

**Overview:**
Crescentism is a faith centered on devotion, discipline, and the unity of all creatures under the Crescent Moon. Its followers, called Crescentites, come from many backgrounds, but the faith is especially strong among desert and migratory species.

## Major Factions (Denominations)
- **First Crescent (Sunni analogue):** Largest group, emphasizes community, tradition, and the Five Pillars of the Path.
- **Moonlit Path (Shia analogue):** Focuses on the guidance of the Imama, a line of spiritual leaders descended from the Prophet.
- **Sufawn Orders (Sufi analogue):** Mystical, focused on personal experience of the divine through art, music, and meditation.

## Core Beliefs
- The Crescent Moon is a sign of guidance and renewal.
- Daily rituals, charity, and fasting are central practices.
- All creatures are equal before the Moon.

## Social Frictions & Issues
- **Sectarian Tensions:** Occasional disputes between First Crescent and Moonlit Path followers over leadership and tradition.
- **Cultural Stereotypes:** Outsiders may view Crescentites as overly strict or foreign.
- **Integration Challenges:** Balancing tradition with modern city life, especially for young Crescentites.
- **Prejudice:** Experiences of discrimination, especially during times of crisis or after high-profile incidents.

## Plot Hooks
- A Crescentite festival is threatened by rumors of violence—players must keep the peace.
- A young Crescentite is accused of breaking a sacred fast; is it a misunderstanding or a setup?
- A Sufawn artifact is stolen, and only those who understand its meaning can recover it.

**Note:** Crescentism is designed to respectfully explore themes of faith, unity, and diversity, while addressing real-world frictions in a child-friendly way.
