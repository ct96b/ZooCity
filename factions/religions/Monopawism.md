# Majority Practitioners & Venn Diagram

**Ethnic/Religious Overlap:**
- The majority of Monopawists are Caprids (goats, ibex, markhor, some antelope), but not all Caprids are religious, and not all Monopawists are Caprids.
- About 70% of Monopawists are Caprids, 20% are rabbits (notably converts and their descendants), and 10% are “odd” predators seeking structure or community.
- The overlap between Caprid ethnicity and Monopawist religion is strong, but not absolute. There are secular Caprids, and there are Monopawists from other backgrounds.
- Prejudice can target either or both groups, and the game explores how ethnic and religious identity can be distinct or intertwined.

**Venn Diagram Summary:**
- Caprid & Monopawist: Classic “full Jew” experience; maximum prejudice, but also strong community bonds.
- Caprid & Secular: Still faces ethnic prejudice, but not religious suspicion.
- Non-Caprid & Monopawist: May face suspicion from both their own ethnic group and from Caprids.
- Non-Caprid & Non-Monopawist: No direct connection, but may still be involved in related plotlines.
# Monopawism (The Law - proxy for the Jews)

**Ethnic/Religious Split:**
- Practiced primarily by Caprids (goats, ibex, markhor, some antelope), but open to all species.
- 70% of adherents are Caprids, 20% rabbits, 10% “odd” predators.

**Core Beliefs:**
- Strict moral code, ritual observance, dietary laws, visible markers (yarn tassels, horn covers).
- Emphasis on justice, community, and tradition.

**Game Mechanics:**
- Advantage on resisting corruption/mind control.
- Once per session: “Sabbath Rest” for healing, but no violence for one hour.
- Social friction from visible markers and dietary rules.

**Prejudice & Social Issues:**
- Converts face suspicion from both prey and predator groups.
- Prejudice can target both ethnic Caprids and non-Caprid converts.

**Factions & Organizations:**
- The Horned League, The Eternal Law Center, Free Hoof Collective, Pawda Watch.

**Plot Hooks:**
- See OrganizationsSummary.md for detailed hooks and campaign ideas.


# Antisemitism (Ethnic and Religious as Distinct Issues)  
**Core Metaphor**: The **Caprids** (goats, ibex, markhor, etc.)** as the primary ethnic proxy + **Monopawism / “The Law”** as the religious proxy.  
These are deliberately separated so players can experience how ethnic hatred persists even when someone abandons the religion, and how religious hatred can target converts and “cultural” practitioners who aren’t “real” Caprids.

**Real-World Parallels** (kept clinical, not preachy):  
- Ethnic → “rootless,” “clannish,” dual-loyalty accusations, blood libels, banking/media conspiracies, Holocaust denial, “they look normal but…” suspicion.  
- Religious → “legalistic,” “separatist,” “old-fashioned rituals,” dietary laws seen as arrogant, circumcision/shaving rituals mocked, “chosen people” twisted into supremacy myth.

**TTRPG Implementation**  

- **Ethnic Background: Caprid Heritage** (available to goats, ibex, a few antelope breeds)  
  - Mechanical bonuses: Sure-footed (climbing, balance), Headbutt attack, ancient literacy (bonus to history/languages).  
  - Permanent social penalties: “Hornhead” slur gives –2 to first impressions with most NPCs; random “loyalty checks” by police/customs (“Do you have ties to the Mountain Republic?” — a nonexistent homeland every bigot swears exists).  
  - Special flaw: **Diaspora Trauma** — once per campaign, when a major ally betrays the party, the Caprid character must make a Will save or gain a temporary Paranoia point (cumulative stress mechanic).

- **Religious Background: Follower of The Law (Monopawism)**  
  - Can be taken by ANY species, but 70 % of adherents are Caprids, 20 % rabbits who converted, 10 % “odd” predators seeking structure.  
  - Bonuses: Strict moral code gives advantage on resisting corruption/mind control; once per session can declare a “Sabbath Rest” for massive healing but cannot act violently for one hour.  
  - Penalties: Visible markers (yarn tassels, horn covers, no mixed fibers clothing) trigger “Ritualist” suspicion; forbidden foods (no pork, no predator/prey meat combos) cause social friction in mixed groups.  
  - Converts get the worst of both worlds: prey see them as “trying to infiltrate,” predators see them as “weak for following prey rules.”

- **Intersection Table (examples)**  
  Caprid + Monopawist = classic “full Jew” experience, maximum prejudice.  
  Caprid + Secular = “You can take the goat out of the temple but…” — still gets banking conspiracy accusations.  
  Non-Caprid + Monopawist = “Wannabe” or “race traitor” hate from both sides.  
  Predator + Monopawist = extremely rare, treated like messianic cults in real life — either revered by fringe groups or hunted as ultimate blasphemy.

- **Specific Prejudice Mechanics**  
  - **Blood Libel Events**: Random encounter table — a child goes missing → 70 % chance the district immediately blames “Caprid ritual murder.” Players can investigate to clear the name or watch a pogrom start in real time.  
  - **Banking Conspiracy Myth**: Major banks are canonically run by elephants and rhinos, but every populist rant claims “the horns really pull the strings.” Caprids own 12 % of banks while being only 2 % of population, explain that!”  
  - **Holocaust Parallel**: Ancient history includes “The Great Culling” — most Caprids pretend it was just a predator rampage, but underground texts say it was organized by both predator warlords AND prey politicians to seize mountain gold. Knowledge of the full truth is illegal in some districts.

- **Factions & Organizations**  
  – **The Horned League** — Caprid self-defense militia (think Jewish Defense League). Ranges from moderate self-defense classes to outright vigilante cells that even other Caprids fear.  
  – **The Eternal Law Center** — legal-aid NGO that sues for discrimination. Hated by right-wing prey as “weaponizing the courts” and by left-wing prey as “not prey enough.”  
  – **Free Hoof Collective** — secular Caprid antizionist activists who denouncing “Mountain Republic myth to prove loyalty. Still called traitors by their own people and never believed by others.  
  – **Pawda Watch** — cross-species watchdog that documents hate. Constantly infiltrated or accused of fabricating incidents.

- **Plot Hooks & Campaigns**  
  – A new “Night Howler 2.0” drug is found in a Monopawist temple basement. Planted? Yes, obviously. But the public doesn’t care — players decide whether to defend the temple (and be labeled accomplices) or stand back and watch it burn.  
  – A young Caprid prodigy gets into elite academy on merit. Series of “pranks” escalate to attempted murder while the administration keeps saying “boys will be goats.”  
  – Ancient artifact (a solid gold menorah-style Everflame Lamp) is stolen. Every faction wants it — some to return it, some to melt it, some to use it to prove supremacy.

The key here is the split: a secular, fully assimilated Caprid character will still get asked “But you’re one of the good ones.” A predator who converts to The Law will be told they’re “trying to atone” or that The Law is “not for” them.

By making the end of a campaign, players who aren’t Caprid or Monopawist will have uttered or thought something antisemitic by accident — and the table will notice. That’s the point.
