# Majority Practitioners & Venn Diagram

**Ethnic/Religious Overlap:**
- Pathism is practiced by animals from all walks of life, with no single ethnic group forming a majority.
- Some traditions (e.g., Wayfarers) are more common among certain species (e.g., elephants, cranes), but all are welcome.
- The overlap between ethnicity and Pathist faith is very loose: Pathists are found in every community, and many ethnicities have both religious and secular members.

**Venn Diagram Summary:**
- No ethnic group forms a majority of Pathists.
- Converts and mixed-background Pathists are common.
- Pathism is a philosophy as much as a religion, and is not tied to any single ethnic identity.
# Pathism (Proxy for Buddhism)

**Overview:**
Pathism is a philosophy and faith focused on self-discovery, compassion, and the journey toward inner peace. Its followers, called Pathists, come from all walks of life, especially those seeking meaning beyond material success.

## Major Factions (Denominations)
- **Wayfarers (Theravada analogue):** Emphasize personal discipline, meditation, and the teachings of the First Walker.
- **Great Caravan (Mahayana analogue):** Focus on compassion, community, and helping all beings reach enlightenment.
- **Diamond Path (Vajrayana analogue):** Known for esoteric rituals, art, and the guidance of spiritual teachers.

## Core Beliefs
- Life is a journey along the Path.
- Suffering can be overcome through understanding, compassion, and mindfulness.
- Meditation, kindness, and wisdom are central practices.

## Social Frictions & Issues
- **Materialism vs. Simplicity:** Pathists may be seen as aloof or impractical by others.
- **Sect Differences:** Debates over the "true" Path and the role of teachers.
- **Cultural Appropriation:** Non-Pathists sometimes adopt Pathist practices superficially.

## Plot Hooks
- A revered Pathist teacher disappears, and the community is in turmoil.
- A wealthy animal seeks to buy a sacred relic, causing outrage.
- A Pathist festival is disrupted by outsiders who misunderstand its meaning.

**Note:** Pathism is designed to explore compassion, wisdom, and the search for meaning, while addressing real-world issues in a gentle, accessible way.
