# Majority Practitioners & Venn Diagram

**Ethnic/Religious Overlap:**
- Sunherdism is practiced by a wide variety of prey species (deer, sheep, cattle, rabbits, etc.), but is open to all.
- Some denominations (e.g., Solar See) are more closely associated with certain ethnic groups (e.g., sheep and cattle), but none are exclusive.
- The overlap between ethnicity and Sunherdist faith is loose: there are Sunherdists from nearly every background, and many ethnicities have both religious and secular members.
- For example, Anglian Communion members are from every walk of life and are the majority of no single ethnicity.

**Venn Diagram Summary:**
- Some ethnic groups have a majority Sunherdist population (e.g., sheep, cattle), but no group is exclusive.
- Many Sunherdists are converts or come from mixed backgrounds.
- There are secular members of all ethnicities, and Sunherdism is not tied to a single ethnic identity.
# Sunherdism (Proxy for Christianity)

**Overview:**
Sunherdism is the largest faith in ZooCity, with roots in ancient sun-worship and a focus on community, forgiveness, and redemption. Its followers believe in the guidance of the Great Shepherd, who leads all herds toward the light. Sunherdism is practiced by many prey species, but is open to all.

## Major Factions (Denominations)
- **Solar See (Roman Catholic analogue):** Centralized, tradition-focused, led by the High Shepherd in Sunspire. Emphasizes ritual, hierarchy, and the authority of the Sunherd Codex.
- **Dawn Orthodox (Eastern Orthodox analogue):** Ancient, mystical, and regionally autonomous. Focuses on tradition, icons, and the wisdom of the Elders.
- **Luminist Synod (Lutheran analogue):** Reformist, scripture-focused, values personal connection to the Great Shepherd. Originated from a split with the Solar See.
- **Anglian Communion (Anglican analogue):** Balances tradition and reform, known for its adaptability and diverse practices across regions.
- **Evangelite Assemblies (Evangelical/Nonconformist analogue):** Emphasizes personal faith, energetic gatherings, and outreach. Less formal, more populist.

## Core Beliefs
- The Great Shepherd watches over all.
- The Sun is a symbol of hope, renewal, and truth.
- Forgiveness and community are central virtues.

## Social Frictions & Issues
- **Inter-denominational Rivalries:** Disputes over doctrine, leadership, and ritual. Occasional schisms and public debates.
- **Prey/Predator Tensions:** Some factions are more open to predators; others exclude them or require special rites for inclusion.
- **Secular Criticism:** Accusations of hypocrisy, corruption, or outdated views from secular animals and reformers.
- **Historical Wrongs:** Legacy of crusades, forced conversions, and conflicts with other faiths (especially Monopawism and the ancient animist cults).

## Plot Hooks
- A Sunherdist leader is accused of corruption—players must investigate truth vs. smear campaign.
- A new sect claims the Great Shepherd was a predator—sparking citywide unrest.
- A Sunherdist orphanage is caught in a funding war between rival denominations.

**Note:** Sunherdism is designed to explore themes of faith, forgiveness, and community, while also addressing the real-world frictions and diversity within Christianity in a respectful, child-friendly way.
