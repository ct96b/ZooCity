# Majority Practitioners & Venn Diagram

**Ethnic/Religious Overlap:**
- Riverism is most common among aquatic and semi-aquatic species (e.g., otters, beavers, crocodiles, turtles, waterfowl), but is open to all.
- Some sects (e.g., Streamkeepers) are especially strong among otters and beavers; others (e.g., Lotus Path) attract a diverse following.
- The overlap between ethnicity and Riverite faith is moderate: many Riverites share a cultural background, but there are Riverites from all walks of life, and many ethnicities have both religious and secular members.

**Venn Diagram Summary:**
- Some ethnic groups have a majority Riverite population, but no group is exclusive.
- Converts and mixed-background Riverites are common, especially in cosmopolitan areas.
- There are secular members of all ethnicities, and Riverism is not tied to a single ethnic identity.
# Riverism (Proxy for Hinduism)

**Overview:**
Riverism is an ancient, diverse faith centered on the sacred flow of the Great River, which connects all life. Its followers, called Riverites, honor many deities and traditions, and the faith is especially common among aquatic and semi-aquatic species.

## Major Factions (Denominations)
- **Streamkeepers (Vaishnavism analogue):** Devoted to the Preserver, who maintains the flow of life.
- **Currentwalkers (Shaivism analogue):** Focused on the Transformer, who brings change and renewal.
- **Lotus Path (Shaktism analogue):** Honors the Source, the creative and nurturing force of the river.

## Core Beliefs
- The Great River is the source and destination of all souls.
- Life is a cycle of flow, change, and renewal.
- Rituals, festivals, and pilgrimages to sacred waters are central.

## Social Frictions & Issues
- **Caste and Class:** Some Riverite communities struggle with old hierarchies, though many reformers push for equality.
- **Religious Festivals:** Large gatherings can cause tension with neighbors or city officials.
- **Conversion and Syncretism:** Riverism often blends with other faiths, leading to debates about purity and tradition.

## Plot Hooks
- A sacred river is polluted, and Riverites seek help to restore it.
- A forbidden romance crosses caste lines, sparking community debate.
- A Riverite festival is threatened by drought or sabotage.

**Note:** Riverism is designed to explore diversity, tradition, and change, while handling sensitive issues in a child-friendly, respectful way.
