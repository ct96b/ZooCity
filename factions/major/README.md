### Economic Mechanics That Feel Like Zootopia

1. **Size-Based Pricing (Universal)**  
   Everything costs more or less depending on your size tier. A coffee is 3 carrots for a rabbit, 30 for an elephant, 0.03 for a mouse. Players constantly feel the inequality in their wallet.

2. **Species Credit Modifier**  
   Predators pay 15–80 % higher interest rates and insurance “just in case.” Caprids get quietly refused loans “due to risk profile.”

3. **Debt & Repossession Track**  
   Miss three payments → repo teams (often IronClaw contractors) show up. They can legally take your home, your collar, even your children if you signed certain predatory school-loan contracts.

4. **Corporate Citizenship**  
   MammothMart offers “employee citizenship” — live in company dorms, shop only at company stores, get company scrip instead of money. Millions choose it because rent is impossible otherwise.

5. **The “Burrow Bond” Market**  
   Rich animals buy bonds backed by poor districts’ future tax revenue. When the district defaults, the bondholder literally owns the streets.

These corporations aren’t just background flavor — they’re patrons, antagonists, reluctant allies, and potential campaign villains or saviors depending entirely on what the players choose to do. A table can run a whole campaign trying to unionize Pawber drivers, another can play IronClaw mercenaries putting down the strike, and both groups are using the exact same setting and rules.
