# ZooCity Map and Geography

ZooCity is built on an island, centered around a massive rocky outcrop about 5 miles in diameter. The downtown district sits atop this outcrop, serving as the city's vibrant core. The city is divided into several unique districts, each with its own climate and character, radiating outward from downtown.

## City Layout
- **Downtown (Central Outcrop):** The heart of the city, atop the rocky island core.
- **Inari District:** A wedge-shaped district from North to Northwest, bordered by the Mongoose River (NW edge) and adjacent to the Rainforest District.
- **Mongoose River:** Flows along the NW edge of Inari District into the Rainforest District.
- **Unnamed River:** Runs southwest from downtown into Savanna Central.
- **Climate Wall:** Extends due east from downtown, separating Tundratown (NE) from Sahara Square (SE).

## Outer Districts (8-10 miles from downtown, clockwise from the Climate Wall):
- **Sahara Square (SE):** Hot, arid, and sunny.
- **Savanna Central (SW):** Lush, open, and diverse.
- **Rainforest District (NW):** Humid, green, and full of life.
- **Tundratown (NE):** Icy and cold.
- **Meadowlands:** Wedge between Rainforest District and Tundratown, on the north edge.
