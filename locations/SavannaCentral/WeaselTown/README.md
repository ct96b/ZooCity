# Weasel Town

A cramped, winding neighborhood tucked into the corner where Vine Country (Rainforest District), Otterdams, and Vole Gardens (Savanna Central) meet. Weasel Town is known for its maze-like alleys, small shops, and a reputation for shady dealings. The area sits on a navigable waterway, close to a major road, and within easy reach of Downtown and the city’s docks.

- **Notable Features:**
  - Weaselton’s Market: A cluster of stalls and shops, some legitimate, some not.
  - Hidden Docks: Small piers for quick getaways or secret deliveries.
  - Alley Maze: A confusing network of backstreets and shortcuts.

- **Common Residents:** Weasels, ferrets, stoats, and other small mammals—plus a few larger animals looking for a deal.

- **Adventure Ideas:**
  - A stolen item is rumored to be hidden in Weasel Town.
  - A chase through the alleys leads to a surprising discovery.
  - Duke Weaselton needs help with a “totally legal” job.
