# ZooCity Setting Overview



ZooCity is a vibrant, animal-run metropolis built on an island, centered around a massive rocky outcrop. Downtown sits atop this outcrop, with diverse districts radiating outward, each tailored for different climates, species, and cultures. The city is surrounded by water—Zootopia Sound, Bayou Bear, Polar Strait, and the northern bay—and is connected by bridges, ferries, and roads to outlying regions and islands.
