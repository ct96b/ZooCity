# Rainforest District

The Rainforest District is a wet, marshy, and vibrant part of ZooCity, crisscrossed by rivers and full of lush greenery. The Mongoose River and the Emerald Flows are the two largest rivers, running east to west—one draining from Downtown, the other from Tundratown. The district is always humid, with rain showers and mist drifting through the trees.

## Subdistricts and Features
- **Vine Country:** South of the Mongoose River, next to the Otterdams section of Savanna Central. Known for its winding vines, small river crossings, and lively markets. A major road from Downtown crosses Otterdams and enters Vine Country, joining another road from Vole Gardens before crossing the Mongoose River into The Canopy.
- **The Canopy:** A cluster of small islands north of Vine Country, across the Mongoose River. Homes and shops are built high in the trees, connected by rope bridges. The Canopy Market is a popular spot for food and crafts.
- **Muddy Swamp:** South of The Canopy, west of Vine Country, and north of Vole Gardens (Savanna Central). A marshy area with hidden paths and lots of wildlife.
- **Canal District:** North of The Canopy, known for its waterways and floating homes (see separate file).
- **Black Jungles:** On the eastern side of the district, bordered by The Meadowlands (NE) and Ficus Grove (south). Dense, mysterious, and full of rare plants.
- **Ficus Grove:** Between the Mongoose River and the Emerald Flows, bordered by Pride Ridge (Tundratown, east) and Inari (Downtown, south). Famous for its giant fig trees and peaceful groves.

## Notable Rivers
- **Mongoose River:** Flows from Downtown, through the district, and into the Rainforest.
