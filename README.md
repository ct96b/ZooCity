# ZooCity Tabletop RPG

Welcome to ZooCity, a kid-friendly tabletop roleplaying game inspired by the world of Zootopia! This project is designed to help Game Masters (GMs) run fun, inclusive, and creative adventures for young players.

## Project Overview
- **Setting:** A vibrant city where animals of all kinds live, work, and play together.
- **Tone:** Lighthearted, adventurous, and focused on teamwork, friendship, and creative problem-solving.
- **Audience:** Kids and families, ages 6 and up.
- **Purpose:** To explore by proxy the sorts of issues that drive parents and adults to do things that the kids need help to understand. 

## Game Master Assistant
This project includes a Game Master Assistant system to help track the world state, manage NPCs, and reduce the GM's workload. The assistant is system-agnostic and can be adapted to any simple, narrative-focused ruleset.

### Key Features
- World Manager and NPC Controller roles
- Easy-to-use world state documentation
- Emphasis on positive, age-appropriate play
- Ready for your own ruleset or a custom system

## Getting Started
1. Review the `GameMasterAssistant_AGENT_RULES.md` for guidelines on using the assistant.
2. Choose or create a simple ruleset for your group.
3. Use the `.campaign/worldstate.md` file to track your campaign's progress.
4. Have fun and encourage creativity, teamwork, and kindness!

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please keep all content appropriate for children and focused on positive, inclusive play.
